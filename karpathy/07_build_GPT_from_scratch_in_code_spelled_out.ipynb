What other data could be fun to blabber on about? (A fun advanced suggestion if you like: train a GPT to do addition of two numbers, i.e. a+b=c. You may find it helpful to predict the digits of c in reverse order, as the typical addition algorithm (that you're hoping it learns) would proceed right to left too. You may want to modify the data loader to simply serve random problems and skip the generation of train.bin, val.bin. You may want to mask out the loss at the input positions of a+b that just specify the problem using y=-1 in the targets (see CrossEntropyLoss ignore_index). Does your Transformer learn to add?

This is why we need to positionally encode tokens.\n","- Each example across batch dimension is of course processed completely independently and never \"talk\" to each other\n","- In an \"encoder\" attention block just delete the single line that does masking with `tril`, allowing all tokens to communicate. This block here is called a \"decoder\" attention block because it has triangular masking, and is usually used in autoregressive settings, like language modeling.\n","- \"self-attention\" just means that the keys and values are produced from the same source as queries. In \"cross-attention\", the queries still get produced from x, but the keys and values come from some other, external source (e.g. an encoder module)\n","- \"Scaled\" attention additional divides `wei` by 1/sqrt(head_size). This makes it so when input Q,K are unit variance, wei will be unit variance too and Softmax will stay diffuse and not saturate too much.
