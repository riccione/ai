## Math

The math is super important for learning AI. Actually AI is not about
programming, it is about math. Of course some programming is necessary.

If you have a good foundation - start with this book:

[Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/)

However, in my case I forgot some aspects from it.
So, let's recover some things:

**PreCalculus**
- Khan
- purple math

**Calculus**:
- Khan
- [MIT: Calculus for beginners](https://math.mit.edu/~djk/calculus_beginners/index.html)
- [MIT: Calculus 18-001](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-18-001-calculus-fall-2023/pages/textbook/)
- [3Blue1Brown: Calculus](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/calculus)
- [Lamar university: Calculus](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calci/calci.aspx)

- [3Blue1Brown: Linear Algebra](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/linear-algebra)

Topics to read and learn: linear math.

## Karpathy

Good motivation and simplicity.
