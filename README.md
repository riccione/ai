## Math

The math is super important for learning AI. Actually AI is not about
programming, it is about math. Of course some programming is necessary.

If you have a good foundation - start with this book:

[Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/)

However, in my case I forgot some aspects from it.
So, let's recover some things:

**PreCalculus**
- Khan
- purple math

**MATH: Calculus and more**:
- Khan
- [MIT: Calculus for beginners](https://math.mit.edu/~djk/calculus_beginners/index.html)
- [MIT: Calculus 18-001](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-18-001-calculus-fall-2023/pages/textbook/)
- [3Blue1Brown: Calculus](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/calculus)

- [Khan Academy - Statistics and Probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)
- [MIT OCW - 18.05 Introduction to Probability and Statistics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/index.htm)

Topics to read and learn: linear math.

## Karpathy

Good motivation and simplicity.
